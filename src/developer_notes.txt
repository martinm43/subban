#Developer Notes, December 26
Playoff positions are decided based on points not "total wins". A new function needs to be created to get points (or use the one from the info_table function. 
Monte Carlo simulation with ties is not exactly easy/intuitive. Need to research further.

Strategy:
Import points to the CPP file - done
Add "points" value to the Team class - done
Change custom comparison function to use points and then wins - done
Add to simulation, Use fact winner gets pt .25 pct of time - done
Need to modify SRS_regress function to provide valid odds
focus on several middle of the road teams and calibrate wins/points using c++ outputs

Tampa Bay: 42 wins
Sabres: 33 wins
Kings: 39 wins
Wild: 49 wins
