#Developer Notes, December 26
Playoff positions are decided based on points not "total wins". A new function needs to be created to get points (or use the one from the info_table function. 
Monte Carlo simulation with ties is not exactly easy/intuitive. Need to research further.

Strategy:
Import points to the CPP file
Use fact winner gets pt .25 pct of time
