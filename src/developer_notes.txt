#Developer Notes, December 26
Playoff positions are decided based on points not "total wins". A new function needs to be created to get points (or use the one from the info_table function. 
Monte Carlo simulation with ties is not exactly easy/intuitive. Need to research further.

Strategy:
Import points to the CPP file - done
Add "points" value to the Team class - done
Change custom comparison function to use points and then wins - done
Add to simulation, Use fact winner gets pt .25 pct of time - done
calibration required
add mighty ducks fix
change names to more appropriate nhl and hockey things
